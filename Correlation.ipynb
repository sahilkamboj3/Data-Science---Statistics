    "<p>The correlation can be used to find out how related (correlated) two sets of samples are to each other. The equation for this is below. Correlation is a value that is between -1 and 1 where is a position correlation represents a position relationship and negative correlation represents a negative correlation(inverse relationship). The more extreme a correlation value is, meaning if it's closer to 1 or -1, the more correlated the two variables. If the correlation is close to 0, the two samples aren't really related to each other.</p>"

    "    Looking at these examples, we see that graphs a and c have strong, positive correlations. Obviously, A has a correlation value of almost 1 since the x and y are closely related to each other. Graph C would also be probably around 0.7 to 0.8 since x and y have a decently strong, positive relationship. Graph B probably has a -0.6 to -0.7 correlation coefficient because x and y are still moderately related to each other but they have an inverse relationship. This means that if they have a negative correlation. Lastlyl, Graph D doesn't really have a relationship between x and y, which means the correlation value is probably around 0 since there isn't a real relationship there.\n",
